#### What is Credit Spread?
To understand credit spread, lets understand few things regarding bonds

```Treasury 5% 2014 113$```
- IOU issued by US govt -> why? it needs to borrow for the services it provides.
- 5% here is called coupon, it's usually `fixed`. Holder of the bonds gets the coupon every year. 
- Every bond issued by government usually has `nominal value`, it's not market price, its the end of the above line `113`.
- Nominal value tells you how much you can expect in coupon terms and it also tells you how much the bond will be worth when government buys in back in 2014. 
- Eg. Think of this as buying a `kilo of carrots` -> it's a `kilo of carrots` for me, you or prime minister. It's fixed, however the `price paid for kilo of carrots` can be negotiable. Similarly, nominal value is 100$, to everybody all the value. But the market price is what the market buys and sells.
- 2014 here is `Redemption or Maturity Date`. 
- Market price can fluctuate everyday as people work out everyday what this bond is worth and it changes accordingly. 
- These are same features of corporate bond and treasury.

What is the return on bond?

1. Income Yield
- Some investors buy for income, they just want to know what 5 dollar coupon means as a percentage of current price today in return terms.
- FY (Flag Yield) -> 5/113 * 100 = 4.4%. 
- Problem with flag yield calculations is they ignore nominal value (113) to some extent -> they ignore that 5 dollars  means you can only get 100 in 2014
- Yield to Maturity -> 13$/4 = 3.25$ capital loss every year.
5 - 3.25/113 * 100% = 1.55% 

Need to check again on how to check yield to maturity calculation.

#### Credit Spreads

- Bond Yield -> coupon + capital gain for an year/ price paid to buy * 100
- Let's say Bond yield is 4.25%, it can expressed in market jargon as 425 basis points.
Let's say ITALY 10 Year 700 b.p.s.

GERMANY 10 Year 200 b.p.s 

Spread is the gap between 700 bps and 200 bps so its `500 bps spread`

Wider that spread, greater the perception of risk.
Faster the spread widens, faster the risk is gathering momentum.

- If investors sell Italian paper, it's going to to Push the paper down and yield up (nominal value is always same).
- Investors buying german bonds then its going to push the paper up and yield down (nominal value is always same).

- In a nutshell, spread is relative risk in bond market and as investor trouble is ahead if you see one of the two things happening.
1. If spread is widening -> trouble
2. Widening even faster -> even more trouble.
